        Hi! I am a student from New Roads. I love the outdoors and took an intrest in nature since I was a kid. I love to go on campouts and go on adventures. I started this site to bring awareness to animal preservation and endangerment. Learn more about what you can do on the index page.
      </p>
      This website has various animals from around the world that can be found if visited their location. The purpose of Implimenting the animals is 
      to bring awareness to the enviornment we live in and how our actions can impact others.
